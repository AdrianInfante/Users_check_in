# Flask Application with SQLite Database Integration

This repository contains a Flask web application that integrates with an SQLite database for managing product information and user statuses. It includes functionality for uploading data from Excel files, updating and deleting user statuses, and scheduling tasks for automating processes.

## Features

- **Upload Excel Data**: Allows users to upload Excel files containing product information (`part_number`, `description`, `Bin`) which are then stored in an SQLite database (`products.db`).
- **Update and Delete Status**: Users can update their status with a date stamp and delete their status records.
- **Integration with Notion**: Updates user status on Notion based on a predefined mapping of user names to Notion page IDs.
- **Scheduled Tasks**: Includes scheduled tasks using the `schedule` library:
  - Automatically runs a script (`DbToDrive.py`) daily at 16:00.
  - Updates Notion status for all users to 'No Status' daily at 23:59.

## Project Structure

- **`app.py`**: Main Flask application script containing route definitions and database operations.
- **`products.db`**: SQLite database file storing product information and user check-in statuses.
- **`templates/`**: Directory containing HTML templates for rendering web pages (`index.html`, `upload_excel.html`, `checkin_list.html`).
- **`static/`**: Directory for static assets (CSS, JavaScript) if any.
- **`DbToDrive.py`**: Python script executed daily to perform tasks related to cloud storage (placeholder).

## Requirements

Ensure you have Python 3.x installed along with the necessary libraries listed in `requirements.txt`. Install dependencies using:

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Getting Started

1. Clone this repository:

   ```
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/your-repository.git
   cd your-repository
   ```

2. Set up a virtual environment (optional but recommended):

   ```
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`
   ```

3. Install dependencies:

   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. Start the Flask application:

   ```
   python app.py
   ```

5. Access the application in your web browser at `http://localhost:5000`.

## Usage

- **Upload Excel File**: Navigate to `/upload_excel` to upload an Excel file with columns `part_number`, `description`, `Bin`.
- **Update Status**: Send a POST request to `/update_status` with JSON payload containing `name`, `status`, `date` to update user status.
- **Delete Status**: Send a DELETE request to `/delete_status` with JSON payload containing `name` to delete user status.
- **View Check-in List**: Navigate to `/checkin_list` to view all user check-in records.
- **Cloud Integration**: Scheduled task runs `DbToDrive.py` daily at 16:00 for cloud integration tasks.

## Notes

- Replace sensitive information (e.g., Notion API keys) with environment variables or secure storage methods.
- Customize error handling and logging as per your application requirements.
